## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```bash
$ npm install overlap-area
```

```html
<script src="//daybrush.com/overlap-area/release/latest/dist/overlap-area.min.js"></script>
```

## üöÄ How to use
```ts
import { isInside, getOverlapPoints, getOverlapSize } from "overlap-area";

const points1 = [
    [0, 0],
    [100, 0],
    [120, 100],
    [0, 100],
];
const points2 = [
    [100, 0],
    [150, 0],
    [150, 100],
    [100, 100],
];

// true
console.log(isInside([50, 50], points1));
// false
console.log(isInside([50, 50], points2));

// [100, 0], [120, 100], [100, 100]
console.log(getOverlapPoints(points1, points2));

// 1000
console.log(getOverlapSize(points1, points2));
```
### User Overlap Areas
Get the areas of the overlapped part of two shapes.
![Overlap Areas](https://daybrush.com/overlap-area/images/overlap.png)

```js
import { getOverlapAreas } from "overlap-area";

const points1 = [
    [150, 100],
    [200, 50],
    [250, 60],
    [300, 100],
    [250, 160],
    [150, 150],
    [200, 120],
];
const points2 = [
    [250, 100],
    [300, 50],
    [350, 60],
    [400, 100],
    [350, 160],

### User Unoverlap Areas
Get non-overlapping areas of two shapes based on points1.

    [150, 100],
    [200, 50],
    [250, 60],
    [300, 100],
    [250, 160],
    [150, 150],
    [200, 120],

        [150, 150],
        [200, 120],
    ],
]
*/
console.log(getUnoverlapAreas(points1, points2));
```
### Calculate the overlap of elements
```js
import { getElementInfo } from "moveable";
import { getOverlapPoints, getOverlapSize } from "overlap-area";

function getPoints(info) {
    const { left, top, pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4 } = info;

    return [pos1, pos2, pos4, pos3].map(pos => [left + pos[0], top + pos[1]]);
}

const points1 = getPoints(getElementInfo(element1));
const points2 = getPoints(getElementInfo(element2));

// Points of the overlapped area
getOverlapPoints(points1, points2);

// Size of the overlapped area
getOverlapSize(points1, points2);
```
